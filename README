This repo contains the implementation of the BestTrees algorithm presented in
"An Efficient Best-Trees Algorithm for Weighted Tree Automata over the Tropical 
Semiring" by Johanna Björklund, Frank Drewes, and Niklas Zechner 
(http://www8.cs.umu.se/research/uminf/reports/2014/022/part1.pdf)
for generating the N best trees given a weighted tree automaton (WTA).

It now also contains as the default the implementation of the improved, 
transition-based algorithm (here called version 2). The corresponding paper
is called "Improved N-Best Extraction with an Evaluation on Language Data" and
can be found here: 
https://direct.mit.edu/coli/article/48/1/119/108848/Improved-N-Best-Extraction-with-an-Evaluation-on


The file wta.format contains the description of the format of the input WTAs.
The example WTA from the paper (wta0.rtg) can be found along with other examples
used for testing in directory wta_examples/.

Quick start: 

Download and run the .jar file by 

java -jar Betty<current_version>.jar [options]

options for Betty:

 -f,--file <wta file>                     file containing the input wta
 -N <nonnegative integer>                 number of trees wanted
 -r,--runs                                finds the best runs instead of
                                          the best trees
 -s,--semiring <semiring>                 semiring used for BestTrees (the
                                          default semiring is the tropical
                                          semiring)
 -t,--type <file type ('wta' or 'rtg')>   file type (detault is wta)
 -timer                                   measures running time(s)
 -trick                                   uses trick that increases
                                          pruning for best runs; not valid
                                          for best trees
 -v,--version <arg>                       version of BestTrees; arg can be
                                          2 (uses a pruned rule queue),
                                          1 (uses a pruned tree queue) or
                                          all (runs all versions).
                                          The default version is 2


Enjoy the forest.
